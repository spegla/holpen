<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<ul>
    <li>PHP 4.3.x or higher</li>
    <li>FTP access and a FTP program</li>
</ul>

<h2>THANKS TO</h2>

<p>I would like to say THANKS to everyone who in any way contributed to the development of this script, especially to (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mauricio Samy Silva, designed the nice readme file you are just reading (<a href="http://www.maujor.com/">www</a>)</li>
    <li>everyone who supported my work by <a href="http://www.phpjunkyard.com/copyright-removal.php">purchasing a license</a></li>
    <li>everyone who posted their suggestions, comments and feedback on the <a href="http://developers.phpjunkyard.com">PHPJunkyard forum</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="install">&raquo; Installation</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold"><span class="dest">Please take 5 minutes time and read installation instructions carefully and completely! This will ensure a proper and easy installation.</span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to your FTP client and FTP to the public directory on your server (where the rest of your website is; usually "public_html", "www" or "site") and create a folder where you will install LinkMan.<br />
Example: /public_html/linkman<br />
Corresponding URL: http://www.yourdomain.com/linkman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload all LinkMan files to this folder <i>except the update.php file</i>. The &quot;img&quot; folder (all files in this folder) must be transferred in BINARY mode, other files in ASCII mode (refer to your FTP client instructions for details on how to set transfer mode properly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that PHP scripts have permission to write to files <b>banned_websites.txt</b>, <b>linkinfo.txt</b> and <b>settings.php</b> - on UNIX (Linux) servers you must CHMOD (set permissions for) these files to 666 (rw-rw-rw-).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that PHP scripts have permission to write to folder <b>apptmp</b> - on UNIX (Linux) servers you must CHMOD (set permissions for) this folder to 777 (rwxrwxrwx).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To configure settings open your LinkMan admin panel (<b>admin.php</b>) in browser, for example:<br />
http://www.yourdomain.com/linkman/admin.php</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To login enter default password: <b>admin</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <b>Settings</b> link from the top menu and configure your LinkMan.
You will find more information about LinkMan settings below
under <a href="#settings">Available Settings</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have done all this your LinkMan should work now.</p>

<p>File <b>links.php</b> is your links page, access it at:<br />
http://www.yourdomain.com/linkman/links.php<br />
or simply use just:<br />
http://www.yourdomain.com/linkman</p>

<p>If you have <b>Show &quot;Add a link form&quot;</b> enabled your links.php page will already display
the form which can be used to add new links to your link exchange. If not you can use the code from
<b>form.html</b> to create your &quot;add a link&quot; form. Modify the look as much as you like.</p>

<p>You may edit header.txt and footer.txt files to add your own header and footer to the links page. You will have to use <b>full image URLs</b> in the code. For example instead of &lt;IMG SRC="images/image.jpg" ... &gt; use &lt;IMG SRC="http://www.yourdomain.com/images/image.jpg" ... &gt;! Same goes for any Javascripts or CSS files if you are calling them from within the header or footer.</p>

<p>Good luck with the script!</p>

<p>Good luck with the script!</p>

<h2 id="help">&raquo; Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><span class="dest">PLEASE READ BEFORE ASKING</span> Since this script is free no support is guaranteed. You will find solutions for some common
problems below. If you can't get the script to work please go through this readme file again carefully and repeat the
installation step-by-step (also delete old files and folders from the server). Also please feel free to FIRST SEARCH for solutions
and then post any questions or problems you might have to <a href="http://developers.phpjunkyard.com">PHPJunkyard forum</a>!</p>

<h3>1. What is CHMOD and FTP?</h3>

<p>I have prepared a simple <a href="http://www.phpjunkyard.com/ftp-chmod-tutorial.php" target="_blank">
FTP and CHMOD tutorial</a> which will help you FTP files to your server and
set correct CHMOD settings.</p>

<h3>2. My LinkMan doesn't work, HELP!</h3>

<p>Here are a few things to check:</p>
<ol>
  <li>did you upload the img folder in BINARY mode and all other files ASCII mode?</li>
  <li>are linkinfo.txt and settings.php files world writable? CHMOD them to 666 (rw-rw-rw) if you are on a UNIX server</li>
  <li>go through the entire setup process again carefully</li>
  <li>are you sure your host supports PHP?</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. How can I stop spammers from posting links?</h3>

<p>Make sure you have these settings enabled (set to <b>YES</b>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Security image</li>
<li>Enable SPAM filter</li>
<li>Block superlatives</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also set <i>Minimum PR to accept website</i> and <i>Minimum reciprocal URL PR</i> to <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> to
block website with low Google PageRank.</p>

<p>Also consider enabling manual link approval so you can approve/reject each link
before it is added to the exchange.</p>

<h3>4. How can I modify the links.php page to fit my website design?</h3>

<p>You can modify the links page by modifying the HTML code inside <b>header.txt</b>
and <b>footer.txt</b> files. All code that is inside header.txt will be printed before links
and all code in footer.txt after links.</p>

<p>If you are not that familiar with HTML code you can try this simple trick.
It is based on my <a herf="http://www.phpjunkyard.com/tutorials/cut-paste-code.php" target="_blank">Cut and paste code into HTML document</a> article (visit it for an example
with screenshots):</p>

<ol>
<li>Use your web page editor to design your links page. Try to keep it simple.</li>
<li>Where you want the links to be displayed enter this text: CODE_HERE</li>
<li>Save it to a file and open that file in a text editor like Notepad or Wordpad</li>
<li>Find the CODE_HERE text inside the code (you can use the search function).</li>
<li>Now copy and paste all the code <b>above</b> CODE_HERE into <b>header.txt</b>
and all code <b>below</b> CODE_HERE into <b>footer.txt</b></li>
<li>Upload header.txt and footer.txt to your server</li>
<li>Now open your links.php page and you should see the new design (refresh the page if not).</li>
</ol>

<h3>5. Where is the admin panel?</h3>

<p>To access LinkMan administration panel open <b>admin.php</b> in your browser, for example:<br />
http://www.yourdomain.com/links/admin.php<br />
(change the URL to the actual URL of admin.php on your server)</p>

<h3>6. I am manually approving links but don't get an e-mail when a link is submitted?</h3>

<p>Make sure PHP mail() command is configured properly on your server and that your Admin e-mail
is set correctly in the admin panel settings.</p>

<h3>7. Links for approving/rejecting links don't work</h3>

<p>Make sure URL to approve.php is set correctly to the URL of approve.php on YOUR server in your admin panel settings.</p>
